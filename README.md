# pong_program (python2)
project for Coursera RiceU. An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python 
(Part 1) (https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1), part of the 
Fundamentals of Computing specialization 
(https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals).

Project Description:
In this project, we will build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade 
video games (1972). While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to 
today's video games, Pong is relatively simple to build and provides a nice 
opportunity to work on the skills that you will need to build a game like 
Asteroids. As usual, we have provided a program template that can be used to 
guide your development of Pong.

Notes:
The attached program will only work on CodeSkulptor since it uses a 
Codeskulptor native module 'simplegui'. CodeSkulptor is a web IDE made for the 
Coursera coureses referenced above. 
Python2 version:
